# SchemaForm

The `SchemaForm` requires two `props`. The first is the `schema`, which is the meta-data of your form. The second one is `modelValue`, which will hold the state of the form.

```html
<SchemaForm :schema="mySchema" :modelValue="formData" />
```

The `SchemaForm` will `$emit` **update:modelValue** events when your components update. This means that you are able to either:

- use `v-model` on it
- or, manually capture the `@update:modelValue` event with a method of your own while injecting the `:modelValue` property.

Example with `v-model`:

```html
<template>
  <SchemaForm :schema="mySchema" v-model="formData" />
</template>

<script>
import { ref } from 'vue'
export default {
  setup() {
    const formData = ref({})
    const mySchema = ref({
      // some schema here
    })

    return {
      formData,
      mySchema
    }
  }
}
</script>
```

Example with manual bindings:

```html
<template>
  <SchemaForm
    :schema="mySchema"
    :modelValue="formData"
    @update:modelValue="updateForm"
  />
</template>

<script>
import { ref } from 'vue'
export default {
  setup() {
    const formData = ref({})
    const mySchema = ref({
      // some schema here
    })

    const updateForm = form => {
      formData.value = form
    }

    return {
      formData,
      mySchema,
      updateForm
    }
  }
}
</script>
```

## Props

### schema

The `SchemaForm` component requires you to pass it a `schema` property. This `schema` can be either an `object` or an `array`.

In its simplest form, the `schema` requires you to provide an object with a `modelName: value` pair for each of the form components you want to add to your form.

Letâ€™s assume for this example that you have a component in your project called `FormText` which exposes an `<input>` tag with some CSS.

```html
<template>
  <SchemaForm :schema="schema" v-model="formData" />
</template>

<script>
  import { SchemaForm } from 'formvuelate'
  import FormText from 'path/to/FormText'
  import { ref, markRaw } from 'vue'

  markRaw(FormText)

  export default {
    components: { SchemaForm },
    setup() {
      const schema = ref({
        name: {
          component: FormText
        },
        lastName: {
          component: FormText
        }
      })
      const formData = ref({})

      return {
        schema,
        formData
      }
    }
  }
</script>
```

:::tip
In the above example, we use the component `FormText` that we imported as the value of the `component` property of each element.

You can use the name of the component as a `String` instead, for example `'FormText'`, but be aware that the component needs to either be imported globally.

If you need to declare your components locally, you can leverage the second parameter of the `SchemaFormFactory` component. Please refer to the [plugins](plugins/#using-locally-imported-components) documentation for more information on how to accomplish this.
:::

#### Array Schemas

For `array` based schemas, we need to provide an object for each element of the form, but instead of providing a `modelName: value` structure, we declare a `model` property inside of each object.

Here's the above example again using `array` format.

```html
<template>
  <SchemaForm :schema="schema" v-model="formData" />
</template>

<script>
  import { SchemaForm } from 'formvuelate'
  import FormText from 'path/to/FormText'
  import { ref, markRaw } from 'vue'

  markRaw(FormText)

  export default {
    components: { SchemaForm },
    setup() {
      const schema = ref([
        {
          component: FormText,
          model: 'name'
        },
        {
          component: FormText,
          model: 'lastName'
        }
      ])
      const formData = ref({})

      return {
        schema,
        formData
      }
    }
  }
</script>
```

An important feature about array schemas is that they allow us the flexibility to create not only vertical forms, but horizontally aligned inputs.

Consider the following meta schema.

```js
const SCHEMA = [
  [ {}, {}, {} ], // 3 inputs in a row
  {}, // 1 input in a row
  [ {}, {} ] // 2 inputs in a row
]
```

The first and second elements of the schema array are sub-arrays. These sub arrays will be displayed by `SchemaForm` horizontally by applying a display of `flex` to their containing `div` element.

:::tip
The `div` will have a class named `schema-row` to apply the layout. You can target this class to modify the behavior, or even add `style` or `css` classes to your inputs by passing them through the schema.

The example below applies a `margin-right` style to the first input.

<iframe src="https://codesandbox.io/embed/fvl-horizontal-form-nfefc?fontsize=14&hidenavigation=1&module=%2Fsrc%2FApp.vue&theme=dark"
     style="width:100%; height:500px; border:0; border-radius: 4px; overflow:hidden;"
     title="FVL Horizontal Form"
     allow="accelerometer; ambient-light-sensor; camera; encrypted-media; geolocation; gyroscope; hid; microphone; midi; payment; usb; vr; xr-spatial-tracking"
     sandbox="allow-forms allow-modals allow-popups allow-presentation allow-same-origin allow-scripts"
   ></iframe>

### schemaRowClasses

If you ever require to add additional classes to each structural row in the generated form, you can use the `schemaRowClasses` property of the `SchemaForm` component to inject them.

These classes will be appended, and will _not_ substitute the `schema-row` class that FormVueLate already provides.

The `schemaRowClasses` prop accepts `[String, Object, Array]` as valid types, conforming to Vue's [class and style binding syntax](https://v3.vuejs.org/guide/class-and-style.html#binding-html-classes)

```html
<SchemaForm
  schemaRowClasses="my-custom-class-a my-custom-class-b"
  :schema="mySchema"
/>
```

Example output:

```html

<form>
  <div class="schema-row custom-class-a custom-class-b">
    [...]
  </div>
</form>

```
### preventModelCleanupOnSchemaChange

By default `SchemaForm` cleans up the value output of properties that are no longer present inside the schema every time the schema changes.

That means that if at runtime the schema deletes one of the elements inside of it, the output of the `modelValue` of `SchemaForm` will no longer contain the user's data if it was already present.

Let's pretend that you have a form that is built with the following schema.

```js
name: {
  label: 'Name',
  component: FormText
},
lastName: {
  label: 'Last name',
  component: FormText
}
```

If the user fills out both of the inputs, you can expect an output like the following.

```js
{
  name: 'Bobba',
  lastName: 'Fett'
}
```

If at this point your schema changes, and deletes the `lastName` property, `SchemaForm` is smart enough to remove that from the output and emit a new `update:modelValue` event since that field is effectively _gone_.

```js
{
  name: 'Bobba'
}
```

If you want to disable this behavior, set the `preventModelCleanupOnSchemaChange` to `true` in your `SchemaForm` component.

```html
<SchemaForm
  :preventModelCleanupOnSchemaChange="true"
  :schema="mySchema"
/>
```

Now `SchemaForm` will not automatically delete the `lastName` property, even if `schema` removes the property, and you will preserve the value of the input if it was already present.

### markRaw

You will notice that on our examples we use `markRaw(MyImportedComponent)
` whenever we import a component that is going to be used directly in a reactive schema.

When making a `schema` reactive by either using `ref` or `computed` and setting the components inside directly as the import as in the following example, we are technically also making the component itself reactive.

```js
import MyComponent from 'components/MyComponent.vue'

[...]
const schema = ref({
  name: {
    component: MyComponent
  }
})
[...]
```

Vue will throw a warning in these cases letting you know that making a component reactive is not something you want to do. It will also hint that you can use either `shallowRef` or `markRaw` to address the problem.

We will not go into detail of what these do, because the [Vue 3 documentation](https://v3.vuejs.org/api/basic-reactivity.html#markraw) already covers it in more detail - but we have opted to show the `markRaw` solution because when creating a `computed` schema, which can not also be a `shallowRef`, marking your components with `markRaw` gets the job done without much further thought.

The previous example then, should be enhanced like so.

```js
import { ref, markRaw } from 'vue'
import MyComponent from 'components/MyComponent.vue'

markRaw(MyComponent)

[...]
const schema = ref({
  name: {
    component: MyComponent
  }
})
[...]
```

:::tip
`markRaw` is not needed when working with `String` format for component names in the schema, since FormVueLate leverages `:is` from Vue's component behind the scenes. Read more about [using locally imported components](/guide/plugins.html#using-locally-imported-components)
:::

## Handling submit

`SchemaForm` will automatically create a `<form>` wrapper for you on the top level `SchemaForm` in the case of single and multi dimensional schemas, and fire a `submit` event when the form is submitted.

This `submit` event will `preventDefault` so you can handle the submit on your end.

In order to react and listen to the `submit` events, simply add a `@submit` listener to the `SchemaForm` component in your template.

```html
<template>
  <SchemaForm
    @submit="onSubmit"
    v-model="myData"
    :schema="mySchema"
  />
</template>
```

## Slots

`SchemaForm` provides two slots for you to add additional elements to your form.

A `beforeForm` slot will be provided before the top-most rendered `SchemaForm`.

Use this for scenarios where you want to provide some element to your form _after_ the `<form>` tag, but _before_ the `SchemaForm`.

```html
<form>
  <!-- beforeForm slot content goes here -->
  <SchemaForm />
</form>
```

An `afterForm` slot will be provided after the rendered `SchemaForm`.

Use this to add elements _after_ the `SchemaForm` and _before_ the wrapping `</form>` tag. A good example would be a submit button.

```html
<form>
  <SchemaForm />
  <!-- afterForm slot content goes here -->
</form>
```

:::tip
Always use the `afterForm` slot to add your `type="submit"` button, that way it will be rendered inside the `form` tags.

You don't have to listen to this `submit` button's click events, as `SchemaForm` will take care of emitting a `submit` event whenever it is clicked, or the form is submitted in any other way. [Read more about handling form submits](#handling-submit)
:::

## Component Requirements

Now that you have your schema bound into the `schema` prop, you need to make sure that your components are understood by `SchemaForm`.

First, make sure that your component accepts a `modelValue` property. `SchemaForm` will bind into this property to pass down the current value of the input.

Next, make sure that your component emits an `update:modelValue` event with the payload of the new input's value whenever it changes. This will allow `SchemaForm` to update the data internally and emit the update event to the parent.

Example of a simple input component:

```html
<template>
  <input
    type="text"
    :value="modelValue"
    @input="$emit('update:modelValue', $event.target.value)"
  />
</template>

<script>
export default {
  props: {
    modelValue: {
      required: true,
      type: [String, Number]
    }
  }
}
</script>
```
